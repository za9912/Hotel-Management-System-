Developed a hotel management system with a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for managing reservations, 
room availability, and customer information. The interface allowed for seamless navigation and included functionalities such as:

Room booking management (check-in, check-out).
Customer data handling (adding, updating, and deleting client records).
Real-time room availability updates (for efficient operations).
